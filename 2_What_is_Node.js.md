# What is Node.js?

Node.js is a **cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment** — but what does that really mean?

## 🧩 Breaking it Down:

- **JavaScript Runtime Environment**: This refers to any environment where JavaScript code can be executed. Browsers like Chrome and Firefox are examples of JS runtimes — but they only work inside web pages.

- **Cross-platform**: It runs seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- **Node.js**: It brings JavaScript out of the browser, letting you write backend logic, servers, tools, and command-line applications — all in JS.

## ✅ Key Benefits

- Full-stack development with a single language (JavaScript)
- Massive ecosystem (npm)
- Built-in async and non-blocking capabilities
