# Limitations and How to Handle Them

Node.js is **not great** for everything.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Problem:

- CPU-intensive operations (image processing, data crunching) can **block the event loop**.
- This means all requests freeze.

## üîß Solutions:

- `worker_threads` module (built-in)
- `child_process` to spawn external work
- Use microservices for heavy tasks
- Offload to cloud functions
