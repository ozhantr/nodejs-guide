# How Node.js Utilizes CPU Cores

Out of the box, Node.js runs on **one CPU core**. But modern CPUs have many.

## Strategies to Scale:

* **Cluster module**: Run multiple Node.js processes
* **PM2**: Process manager for clustering, monitoring
* **Docker + Load Balancing**: Perfect for scalable production

## Smart Design:

Run one Node.js process per core.\
Use a load balancer to route requests.\
Boom — multi-core scalability achieved.
