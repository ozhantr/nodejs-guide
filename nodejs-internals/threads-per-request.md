# Why Node.js Doesnâ€™t Use Threads Per Request

Unlike Java or PHP, Node.js doesn't create a new thread for each HTTP request.

## Traditional Server (e.g. Apache):

* Each request spawns a thread
* More threads = more RAM
* High context-switching cost

## Node.js Approach:

* One thread handles all requests
* Asynchronous delegation = less memory usage
* Scales to 10k+ concurrent users easily
